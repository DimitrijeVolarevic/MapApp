# MapApp 

In this app, we imported several real-world locations such as the Colosseum and the Eiffel Tower and others, and then displayed them on the map with a nice UI. The focus of this project is on MVVM architecture and the use of only SwiftUI frames, alignments, animations, and transitions.

Note: We are using the native SwiftUI Map from MapKit. The map location is based on latitude and longitude coordinates.
